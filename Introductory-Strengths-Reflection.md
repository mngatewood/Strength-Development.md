# Introductory Strengths Reflection & Coaching Request

### In-Class Reflections Using the Signature Themes Report
**Read through the definitions**:

1. What words or phrases stick out to you for each theme?

   **Input:** Inquisitive, data acquired and stored away (for potential future value), finds so many things interesting
   
   **Learner:** Process of learning (more than the content or result), getting there, thriving when learning a lot in a short time

   **Maximizer:** Excellence, compelled to nurture strenghts of others, discriminating, don't want to spend your life bemoaning shortcomings

   **Relator:** Being around close friends

   **Analytical** Challenging other people, objective, rigorous, search for patterns and connections
    
2. How would you define each of your top 5 talents in your own words?

   **Input:** I have many interests and enjoy learning as much as possible in these interests, sometimes to the point of obsession.  I prefer to observe and listen, rather than speak, in order to acquire as much information as possible.
   
   **Learner:** I enjoy learning things for the sake of learning. I need to be stimulated in my work and I will seek tasks and projects that fulfill this need, sometimes to the point that my performance suffers in other areas important to my position.

   **Maximizer:** Rather than improving my weaknesses, I prefer to maximize my strengths. I adjust my leadership style according to my audience and I always use an approach that is most effective for that particular individual.

   **Relator:** I am most comfortable around those with whom I am very close. I don't seek out new relationships, nor do I have as many acquiantances as most.  But I cherish the relationships I do have with unwavering loyalty.  

   **Analytical** I am a logical person motivated primarily by my own curiosity.  I like to get to the bottom of things and seek out factual evidence, often examining things from new, previously obscured perspectives.
    
3. Do these top 5 talent themes resonate with you? Why or why not? 

  All five strengths ring very true, though it did take several reads and a lot of introspection to see it.  My biggest challenge so far is viewing the "relator" talent as something positive; particularly with so much emphasis being placed on networking these days.

*Now, go find partners to introduce yourself to using these 5 areas*
